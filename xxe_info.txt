the information below is taking from the video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjm6VHZa_8s
some info about the xxe attack:
xxe attack also called xml external entities is attack that the attacket
can corupt some xml code/parser in order to see files on the server side or 
to make the server to download some specific files from remote source
xxe attack have three types:
1. inband - which the xml parser will be run and the output will be 
shown directly on the screen. for example we can write entity which contain
the passwd file, and we will mention it in the xml file, so the parser will show
us the output of the passwd file.
2. error based - kind of blind xxe where we cant see so usefull information
except of some errors.
3. out of band xxe - 100% blind xxe, we dont see the output.
for example we can redirect the specific output to our website request as url.
**important** as much as i understand this attack can occur while sending a
website with an xml parser, just an xml file which he can parse - but still need to check when and how this attack can occur.
