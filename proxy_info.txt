This is a text file which include all the new things we know about the proxy.py file.
There are the addons class build in functions, that are using for modify or seeing the transportation
the proxy get into it, and options are the way for us to configure our proxy.
To run the proxy from the project directory, run the following command in the terminal:
~/Downloads/mitmproxy-5.3.0-linux/mitmproxy -s proxy.py

Errors we have:
1. The package the proxy get does not move throw the response/request functions
in the addons. - Fixed
2. The websites does not trust the mitmproxy default certificate (as much as i know), so we need to make them
trust the certificate.
