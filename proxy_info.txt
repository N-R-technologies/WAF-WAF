file. first, there are the addons class build in functions, that are using for modify or seeing the transportation
the proxy get into it. and options is the way for us to set up options for our proxy;
errors we have:
1 the package the proxy get does not move throw the response/request functions
in the addons.
2 the websites does not trust the mitmproxy default certificate (as much as i know), so we need to make them
trust the certificate.
